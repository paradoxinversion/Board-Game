# Board-Game
A simple board game framework in Unity3d

The main goal of this project is to be a quick starting point for those looking to make board games in Unity. Boards are made by adding Tile Prefabs to a scene and setting up 1-4 variables on each. The framework is made in 2d using sprites, but can be adapted to 3d with little work.

Three example maps and an extended README are included in the project.
